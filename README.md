## What is an operating system??<br>
`Basically it is responsible for operating the system. After the system is booted, all the application that we see and be able to use is because of operating system. So, this lies above our hardware and it acts as a communicator between hardware and user(user can command hardware to function through operating system.)`


## what is Hardware??<br>
`Just the physical component of a computer. So what we see and use to run a os or softwares are done in a hardware. We use it to store and run the written instructions provided by the software and many more`

## what is Kernal<br>
`A core component of a operating system and serves as the main interface between the physical hardware and the operrating system. It exsisits within the kernal and controls all the major functions of the hardware. This is the same in all kinds of computer wheather it be a phone, server, etc.`

## what is Desktop Environment?<br>
`A desktop environment is a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a way for you to interact with your computer. <br>Imagine your computer as a blank room, and the desktop environment is the furniture, decorations, and layout that make it functional and easy to live in. Without it, you'd be staring at a blank wall (the raw operating system), and you'd need to do everything by typing in commands, like trying to live in a house without any furniture, doors, or appliances.(from chatgpt). <br>`
### examples <br>
- windows shell or windows desktop environment
- aqua for mac
- gnome / kde for linux
  
`Also, The desktop environment is not the same as an operating system, but it works on top of the operating system to make it easier for you to interact with. Let’s break this down with an analogy. <br>`

`## Analogy: Operating System vs. Desktop Environment <br>
Think of your computer like a car: <br>`

`The operating system (OS) is the engine of the car. It controls how everything works behind the scenes—how the computer talks to the hardware, manages files, runs programs, and performs tasks. Examples of operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux. <br>
The desktop environment (DE) is the dashboard of the car. It’s the part you interact with directly—the steering wheel, speedometer, buttons, and touchscreen. It doesn’t run the car, but it helps you control the car in a simple way.`
  
## Runtime<br>
`A runtime environment is where programs will be executed. Traditionally, javascript could only be used in a browser application and seperate environment was needed so that we could test it and run it first. Thats where nodejs(a popular javascript runtime) came in. There are other several runtime environments and might even be better. Some examples are deno, bun, etc.`

## Compiled Languages <br>
`I write a code in any programming language and when i execute it, It is first transformed into machine level code to make the computer understand the users command.`

## Transpiled Languages <br>
`I write some code in any high level language and it is transformed into another high level language. For example, Typescript is higher level language which after transpiling is converted to JavaScript which is also another higher level language. Babel for example can transpile JavaScript ES6 syntax into ES5 syntax to get support from all the older browsers.`
